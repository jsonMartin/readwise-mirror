# Changelog
## 1.4.1 (2023-10-27)
This update adds better support for Readwise article highlighting and default tag template support. Thanks to first time contributor @tdznr for adding to this release.

- Feature: Add "Open in Readwise" link when Readwise `url` field is present. The `url` field contains the link to Readwise's website showing the highlighted snippet in context of the source.
  - The `url` field is not available for book types, but is available for other content types such as Articles.
- Feature: Show tags in default highlight template

## 1.4.0 (2023-08-18)
Thanks to @johannrichard for the following contributions:

### Features
- Feature: ✨ add frontmatter tag field
- Feature: ✨ roll-up of highlight tags into frontmatter
  - a rolled-up (deduplicated) list highlight tags can be used in frontmatter via the field `quoted_highlight_tags`
- Feature: ✨ user setting for "colon" (:) replacement
  - The colon in a title is a special character which by default is replaced witha a dash (-) in filenames. With this change, users can choose what string to use as a replacement.
- Feature: ✨ Multi-line text can be filtered with the `bq` filter
  - The filter adds the `>` character after each line-break
  - With this, you can get multi-line text blockquotes in your templates working correctly
    ### Example
    The following highlight
    ```
    Multi-line text in blockquotes

    This is an example of a multi-line highlight with line-breaks.
    ```
    ... with this template
    ```markdown+nunjucks
    > [!quote]
    > {{ text | bq }}
    ```
    will turn into
    ```markdown
    > [!quote]
    > Multi-line text in blockquotes
    >
    > This is an example of a multi-line highlight with line-breaks.
    ```
